In the next screen, the new user can be assigned to one or more groups. If adding a 'city level' user, simply assign the user to the city they will have permission to view. Continue adding groups until you have configured the new users permissions.

If this new user should be able to login to the admin interface and administer users, check the `Staff` checkbox. Click `Save` to create the new user.

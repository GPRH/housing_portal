# Introduction

The GPRH portal is a platform for visualizing the results of The World Banks' [Global Program for Resilient Housing](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/disasterriskmanagement/brief/global-program-for-resilient-housing). Each portal instance represents the results of the work conducted in a particular country. In general, each country has several **Areas of Interest (AOI)** that have been mapped using the project methodology. The portal allows a user to select an Area of Interest to visualize and query.
